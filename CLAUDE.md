## Architecture and Design

### Current Implementation
The project follows Clean Architecture with implemented:

â””â”€â”€ main.dart                      # App entry point with Riverpod setup
```

### State Management Strategy
- **Primary**: Riverpod for dependency injection and state management (implemented)
- **Theme Management**: StateNotifierProvider with SharedPreferences persistence
- **Service Locator**: GetIt configured for dependency injection
- **Repository Pattern**: Planned for data sources

### Key Dependencies (Implemented)
- `flutter_chat_core: ^2.0.7` - Core chat functionality
- `flutter_chat_ui: ^2.0.7` - Chat UI components
- `flutter_riverpod: ^2.4.9` - State management
- `riverpod_annotation: ^2.3.3` - Code generation for providers
- `get_it: ^7.6.4` - Service locator/dependency injection
- `shared_preferences: ^2.2.2` - Local data persistence
- `sidebarx: ^0.17.1` - Sidebar navigation component
- `google_fonts: ^6.1.0` - Typography system
- `flutter_animate: ^4.3.0` - Animation framework

## Design System

### Theme Architecture (Implemented)
- **Dual Theme Support**: Light and dark themes with system integration
- **Theme Persistence**: SharedPreferences with automatic loading
- **Custom Color Extensions**: Professional blue-based color scheme with extensions
- **Typography**: Inter font family with consistent scale
- **Material 3**: Full Material 3 design system implementation

### Theme Provider Usage
```dart
// Access theme state
final themeMode = ref.watch(themeProvider);
final isDark = ref.watch(isDarkModeProvider);

// Theme actions
ref.read(themeProvider.notifier).toggleTheme();
ref.read(themeProvider.notifier).setThemeMode(AppThemeMode.dark);

// Extension methods
ref.themeNotifier.toggleTheme();
bool isDark = ref.isDarkMode;
```

### Platform Support
- **Target Platforms**: Web (modern browsers), Desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- **Web Rendering**: CanvasKit for optimal performance
- **Responsive Design**: Breakpoint-based layouts with responsive utilities

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Follow feature-based organization over file-type grouping
- Use Riverpod providers for state management
- Implement proper theme integration using extension methods
- Use responsive utilities for layout adaptation

### Theme Development
- All UI components inherit from centralized theme system
- Use AppColors extensions for consistent color usage
- Implement custom theme-aware widgets using Consumer/ConsumerWidget
- Theme switching includes smooth 300ms transitions

### Performance Considerations
- Theme state is cached and persisted automatically
- Responsive breakpoints optimize layouts per device
- Virtual scrolling planned for chat message lists
- Proper disposal of providers and controllers

## Testing Strategy

### Current Test Structure
- `test/widget_test.dart` - Basic app smoke test with Riverpod integration
- Tests verify app initialization and basic UI rendering
- Theme switching and provider state testing needed

### Testing Focus Areas
- Theme persistence and state management
- Riverpod provider behavior
- Responsive layout across breakpoints
- Cross-platform functionality

## Project Configuration

### Flutter Configuration
- **Flutter Version**: 3.8.1+ (specified in pubspec.yaml)
- **Dart Version**: 3.8.1+
- **Platforms**: Web, Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android
- **Analysis**: flutter_lints ^5.0.0 for code quality
- **Code Generation**: build_runner for Riverpod and JSON serialization

### State Management Setup
The app uses ProviderScope at the root level with:
- ThemeNotifier for theme state management
- Automatic theme persistence and loading
- System theme detection and following
- Extension methods for convenient access

## Implementation Status

### Completed Features
- âœ… Complete theme system (light/dark/system)
- âœ… Riverpod state management setup
- âœ… Material 3 design system
- âœ… Theme persistence with SharedPreferences

- The frontend_specifications.md contains comprehensive design requirements
- Always use the existing theme system for new UI components
- Follow the established Riverpod patterns for state management
- Maintain responsive design principles for all new features
